# 🚀 Kubernetes Troubleshooting: The Ultimate Hands-on Course

Welcome to the **Kubernetes Troubleshooting** repository! This project is the companion to the Udemy course, designed to help you go from "It's not working!" to "Here's the fix!" through realistic laboratory scenarios.

---

## 🛠️ The "Break-Fix" Learning Strategy
This course doesn't just show you YAML. It gives you the tools to:
1. **Recreate**: Intentionally trigger production-grade failures.
2. **Diagnose**: Use `kubectl`, logs, and investigation tools to find the root cause.
3. **Resolve**: Apply fixes and verify the solution.
